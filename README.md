# Big Mart Sales
 
This is a part of my hands-on approach to learning data science. I have used the BigMart Sales data from Kaggle as a practice dataset for data cleaning and feature engineering. I've focused more on cleaning data and understanding the data in the project rather than building the model. I've used basic EDA methods to do the feature selection.

The model is not comprehensive enough to accurately predict the data. With 60% accuracy, the model is underperforming. I might look into the model in the future.
