# Big Mart Sales
 
This is a part of my hands on approach to learning data science. I have used the BigMart Sales data from Kaggle as a practice dataset for data cleaning and feature engineering. I've focused more on cleaning data and understanding the data in project rather then building the the model. I've used basic EDA methods to do feature selection.

The model is not comprehensive enough to accuratly pridict the data. With 60% accuracy the model is underperforming. I might look into the model in the future.
